            During this time, I took an artistic training course at the ArtFuture school in St. Petersburg,
            modeling course at the Autodesk Certified Center for 3ds Max at ITMO University,
            author's course on 3D visualization with one of the most talented 3D visualizers, Dmitry Kurilov.<br>
            Also during this time I have completed several projects. The projects were invented by me inside and out,
            except for the kitchen-living room project, I made it according to the reference from the Internet.<br>
            The work on the project consisted of creating a room, setting up lighting, selecting furniture and
            decor from the catalog, including independent modeling of individual elements, setting
            materials, setting angles, visualization and post-processing in Photoshop. 3d visualization
            this is what completely fascinates me, I make every effort to achieve high-quality
            result, along the way learning new things. For me, the process of creating 3D visualization is extremely exciting.
            a process from which it is simply impossible to break away.<br>
            <p>To create the renders were used: 3Ds Max, Corona Renderer, Photoshop.</p>"
